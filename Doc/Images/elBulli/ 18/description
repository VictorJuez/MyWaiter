Morphings
This beautiful pink coral is dark chocolate coated by sour raspberry powder. After savoring it I dug into the brown piece what seemed like it could be some sort of strange bread, possibly sweet. I expected the taste to be in any shape and size - it looked beautiful so I tried it. It was a rock. So Adri√† has fooled us once again. Thank you, for this great and memorably evening!
